Run the command below to get foundryup, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your PATH, run it to get the latest forge and cast binaries:

```
foundryup
```
Advanced ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found in the [foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md)

cd proposal143
forge build
```

## Instructions

```
Note:*The test will fail if it is run after the proposal goes into an active state, but if you want to run it, try adding block 16392065 to the command and adding the "--fork-block-number" flag.*
